- everything you would expect a modern player to have
- fast loading speed (most videos load in 3s)
- livestream support
- minimalistic UI, configurable theme color
- persistent library on the home page with thumbnails, titles, durations, and per-video metadata
- filter the library by **site**, **tags**, and **categories** (populated from source metadata when available) plus live text search

## Library

Every video you play is saved by default, so it stays available on your next visit.

- The home page **is** your library: a thumbnail grid with title, duration, and uploader, grouped by source site
- Filter chips at the top let you narrow down by **sites**, **categories**, and **tags**. Categories and tags are populated from the source's metadata whenever it exposes them; sites that don't just show up under their domain
- Multiple filter chips combine (AND), and the URL/search bar filters on top of the chip selection
- If the source doesn't report a duration, the app runs ffprobe on the downloaded media and writes the real duration back into the local meta so the library display stays accurate
- **Hide** button (eye-slash) on each card removes it from the default view without deleting anything on disk. The button on a site chip hides every video from that site at once
- **Show hidden** in the header toggles the view to include hidden items with an unhide affordance
- The library is stored in SQLite (`data/library.db`) and updated automatically when you play or download a video. The **Rebuild** button walks the data folder and re-syncs the whole table — useful if you manually add or remove files
- Everything (cache, library DB, `.env`, `cookies.txt`) lives under `DATA_PATH` (default `./data`). Set `SAVE_ALL=false` if you want the old behavior where videos auto-expire after `MAX_VIDEO_AGE` seconds


## Planned
- video quality changing without interrupts
- user-side player configuration


## Limitations
- only YT-DLP supported videos work
- video loading times and fallbacks:
    - most videos load in around 3 seconds
    - if it fails, transcoding starts and video loads in around 10s
    - if it also fails, the whole video is getting downloaded until it becomes available
- project is under heavy development - you may expect bugs and issues


## Technologies used
- yt-dlp as a video downloader
- videojs as a robust player
- HLS transcoding for the most reliable playback
- ffmpeg for better format support
- node / deno for solving YT-DLP's js challenges
- sponsorblock integration
- Media Session API integration for system playback controls
- Audio Context API for audio over-amplification and music visualizer


## How to run

App should be accessible at http://localhost:5000

### Docker
- `docker run -p 5000:5000 matszwe02/ytdlp_web_player:stable`
    - if you want stable version, ready for everyday use
- `docker run -p 5000:5000 matszwe02/ytdlp_web_player:latest`
    - if you want latest version - may have new and experimental features, it may also contain more bugs

OR

- Clone repo
- Run `docker compose up`
- For automatic app updates, see `compose.yml`
- To configure via environment: copy `src/example.env` to `data/.env`, modify as needed. The file is loaded automatically from the mounted data folder — no compose changes required
- To enable HTTPS, see `compose.yml`
  - then you can access the HTTPS app with https://localhost:5001
  - your browser will warn you about not secure connection, you need to click on "allow"

### Run locally (Python)

- Create and activate a virtual environment in `src/` and install `requirements.txt`
- optionally install `ffmpeg` and `node`/`deno`, otherwise they will be automatically installed to your venv
- run `main.py`
- To configure via environment: copy `src/example.env` to `data/.env`, modify as needed (the `data/` folder is created on first run)


## Cookies

Some videos need cookies to work. With cookies you will be logged in to the video streaming's website while using the app.

- Create `data/cookies.txt` (the folder is auto-mounted into the container — no compose changes required)
- Paste relevant cookies into that file (I suggest using an extension for that, which exports cookies in netscape format)
    - yt-dlp created a nice [guide](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/wiki/FAQ#how-do-i-pass-cookies-to-yt-dlp) about providing the cookies
- If using extension, you can enable automatic sending of browser cookies for individual videos in extension settings

**Keep in mind that cookies work the same way as your account credentails - anyone having them may [mess up your account](https://youtu.be/yGXaAWbzl5A).**
    
I do not guarantee that cookies file is completly secure from accessing it through the player. Additionally yt-dlp uses them when playing videos on behalf of the provided account. So I only recommend putting throwaway accounts here.


## Extension

YT-DLP Web Player provides an extension that replaces every video in allowed (in extension settings) domains with YT-DLP Player. That results with all of the default video players to be seamlessly replaced with YT-DLP Player

- This extension will disable all media playback on the website, disable native player and create YT-DLP Player's iframe in its place

There are 3 ways of running this extension:

### Browser Extension

Additionally adds `Open in YT-DLP Player` context menu for all links. So you can right-click any link and it is opened in YT-DLP Player directly

- Extension available in [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/yt-dlp-web-player/gnpabpjkhecpnecnlljfjlbbcokccgbj) and [Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/addon/yt-dlp-web-player/)
    - alternatively, you can clone this repo and load it from `/extension` directory
- Put player's URL in extension settings
- In extension settings: enable/disable domains or start/stop temporarily

### Tampermonkey script

- Create a new script and copy extension js from player's dropdown menu (or `/extension/extension.js`)
- In script settings: enable/disable domains or start/stop temporarily
- For some websites you need to install one of `disable CSM` extensions

### Developer Tools script

It is a temporary solution, every page reload clears it
- copy extension js from player's dropdown menu (or `/extension/extension.js`) and paste into developer tools
- For some websites you need to install one of `disable CSM` extensions


## Demo, other use cases

### Demo server

Low performance and may be IP blacklisted due to this server's limitations

https://ytdlp-web-player.vercel.app

### Proof-of-Concept YT-DLP Web Player inside Invidious

https://hub.docker.com/r/matszwe02/invidious_ytdlp_web_player

### Sharing

This player fully supports `Open Graph` - sharing it through social media and messaging apps shows video's title, thumbnail, and allows for direct playback

### Embedding player

If you want to embed this player, use `/iframe?url=...` endpoint


## Troubleshooting

### I can't install PWA / embed it as an iframe / extension does not load

You need a working HTTPS for this, see in [How to run](#how-to-run). Some features will work when you run through HTTP from localhost, but it may not work properly.

### I can't play some videos

Please check if it's supported by yt-dlp [here](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/blob/master/supportedsites.md).

Also check [yt-dlp's issues](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/issues).

You can even try to download yt-dlp and download that video with it, to ensure there is a way to download it.

For debugging locally:
- open `/logs` in the running app to see live stdout/stderr from all workers
- expand the **Debug info** panel on any `/watch` page to see the source URL, its SHA1 hash (used as the data-dir name), the metadata highlights extracted by yt-dlp, and the files currently on disk. There's also a link to the raw `meta.json`

If it appears to be supported, fill in a bug report with app logs.

### Can this app do XYZ?

This readme does not mention every configuration option. See `example.env` and check if the feature you want is already settable. If not, I'm open for feature requests.

### Other issues

Please fill in a bug report. Attach browser and app logs if relevant, app version, browser name, etc.
